# Project Name
E-Commerce Microservices

## Overview
This repository contains an e-commerce system built using .NET 8 with a microservices architecture. The system includes several services such as Authentication, Product, and Order services. It features secure communication using JWT authentication, API Gateway (Ocelot), and middleware enhancements for request validation and exception handling. The database is managed with Entity Framework Core, and the system is designed with RESTful APIs.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular services for Authentication, Product, and Order management.
- **Secure Communication**: JWT authentication for secure service-to-service communication.
- **API Gateway**: Ocelot API Gateway for routing and aggregation.
- **Middleware Enhancements**: Improved request validation and exception handling.
- **Database Management**: Entity Framework Core for managing database operations.
- **RESTful APIs**: Designed using REST principles for scalability and ease of use.
